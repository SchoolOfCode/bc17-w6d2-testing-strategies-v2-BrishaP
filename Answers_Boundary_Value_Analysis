You are tasked with testing a search functionality that allows users to specify the number of results per page. The valid range for the number of results per page is between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

Instructions

Task 1: Identify Boundary Values
Identify the boundary values for the numeric input field.

Lower Boundary: 1
Below Lower Boundary: 0
Above Lower Boundary: 2

Upper Boundary: 100
Below Upper Boundary: 99
Above Upper Boundary:101

Consider both valid and invalid boundary values.

Valid boundary values: Within and including upper and lower boundaries 

Fill in the table below with the identified boundary values.

Boundary Values

### Task 2: Design Test Cases
1. Design test cases to cover the identified boundary values.
2. Ensure that your test cases cover both valid and invalid scenarios.
3. Fill in the table below with the designed test cases.

| Test Case | Input Value | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|

Test cases:
-Test all of the boundary value numbers
Input Value:
